The goal is to get 13 points (or slightly less) for a given round.  
Once you are happy with your number of points, you can â€˜passâ€™.

    the round ends and your score is the number of points that you have earned.
          
    -If the computer gets more points than you (eg: you get 10 and they get 11, then you lose your score stays 
    the same).

    score. The computerâ€™s score stays the same.
